Description: 'rifiComparative' compares the output of rifi_stats from 2 different conditions. 'rifiComparative' is a continuation of rifi package to compare two conditions already treated with rifi. The half-life and mRNA at time 0 are fragmented. The fragmention of HL uses the difference between HL of both condtions and mRNA at time 0 uses the log2FC. The package provides segmentation, statistics, summary table, fragments visualization and some additional useful figures for further anaylsis.
