# RifiComparative

## About

<<<<<<< HEAD

RifiComparative is a workflow designed for comparative analysis of data generated by the Rifi framework (https://github.com/CyanolabFreiburg/rifi). It addresses the challenge of comparing outputs from two different conditions of the same organism, where the transcriptome regulation leads to variations in the Rifi outputs. These variations result in segments with different lengths, positions, and events, making a direct comparison between the two conditions difficult (Figure 1). To overcome this issue, we have developed a strategy (Figure 2). The data from both conditions are combined, and a segmentation approach is applied to determine the half-life and mRNA at time 0 segments for each condition. The absolute value of the half-life difference at the probe level serves as input for segmenting the half-life, while the fold-change of mRNA at time 0 is used for segmenting the intensity. Unlike Rifi, no hierarchical segmentation is employed (Figure 3). Prior to segmentation, a subset of the data is trained to optimize the penalty parameters and ensure the best segmentation results. After segmentation, the fragments are subjected to statistical testing, and a p-value is assigned. To enable a meaningful comparison, the fragments from the half-life and mRNA at time 0 segments are adjusted to align with each other, resulting in fragments of equal length for both parameters (Figure 4). Each fragment corresponds to a specific annotation on the genome. The package provides the capability to plot the half-life and intensity fragments, transcription units (TUs) from each condition, termination events, iTSS_II events, and genome annotations (Figure 5). Furthermore, a series of additional plots are included to facilitate the analysis. For instance, Figure 6 and 7 display decay rate versus synthesis rate, with the option to highlight or label points of interest using the segment annotation. In summary, RifiComparative offers a comprehensive workflow for comparative analysis of Rifi data, allowing for improved comparisons between different conditions of the same organism. The package provides various visualization tools to aid in the interpretation and exploration of the results.
=======
RifiComparative is a workflow for a comparative data, output of Rifi framework (<https://github.com/CyanolabFreiburg/rifi>). RifiComparative compares two outputs from 2 different conditions of the same organism. The rifi outputs are different from one condition to other depending on the transcriptome regulation. We end up with segments with different length, position and events making a direct comparative of 2 conditions nearly impossible (Figure. 1). To solve this issue, we come up with a strategy (Figure. 2). The data from both conditions are gathered together and a segmentation of half-life and mRNA at time 0 of both conditions is applied. The absolute value of half-life difference at probe level is used as input for half-life segmentation on one hand and the fold-change of mRNA at time 0 is used as input for segmentation of intensity on other hand. Differently to rifi, no hierarchy is applied (Figure. 3). As for rifi, a sub-set of the data is trained preliminary to get the best set of penalties and for segmentation usage. After segmentation, the fragments are statistically tested and a p_value is assigned. To make a consistent comparison the fragments from half-life and mRNA at time 0 are adjusted to each other. We end-up with a single fragment length for both parameters (Figure. 4). Each fragment has the corresponding annotation on the genome. The half-life, intensity fragments, the TUs from each condition, events as termination and iTSS_II and the genome annotation could be plotted (Figure. 5). The package provides a serie of plots to facilitate the analysis. Figure. 6 and 7 show decay rate versus synthesis rate. Some points of interest could be colored or labeled using the segment annotation.
