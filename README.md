# Comparative data set from Rifi framework

## About

Rifi framework comparative Data is a comparative output from Rifi framework
(https://github.com/CyanolabFreiburg/rifi). Rifi_comparative_data compares 
two outputs, gene based, from 2 different conditions of the same organism 
(Figure. 1). A dataframe is created assembling annotation and their
corresponding log2FC half-life and log2FC intensity from data +/- treatment. 
The corresponding P_value from statistical tests and P_value adjusted are 
included. Events are gathered together for comparison. 
rifi comparative data provides as well visualization of all segments 
generated by Rifi of both conditions.

log2FC of intensity(cdt1/cdt2)). Red to blue colors show high and low density
respectively. Correlation between both measurement is provided (cor).
